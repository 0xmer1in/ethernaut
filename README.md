Do your best to improve the code security of Solidity.

#### Personal Thoughts

There're various of attack methods in `solidity`, that contracts include bug will be the heaven to hacker.  
Beside, the `Computer Organization` course really help me, especially in `storage`.     
Transform that between `Hexadecimal`, `Decimal`, `Octal`, `Binary` is very important for learning `solidity`.
